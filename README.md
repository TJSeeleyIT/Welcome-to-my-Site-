# Welcome-to-my-Site-
This is just a welcome post to my github site and what I plan to use this for.


My name is Tyler and I currently own SeeleyServices an IT support and networking company. I also do freelance work on upwork and field nation. I currently do desktop support and administration for my local hospital. I currently am learning a lot about MECM and VoIP technologies. I would like to turn this into a repository for systems adminstration scripts and code related to my blog/business website that is in the works.
